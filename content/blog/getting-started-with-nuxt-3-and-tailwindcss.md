# Getting Started with Nuxt 3 and TailwindCSS

Nuxt 3 is a powerful framework for building Vue.js applications with improved developer experience and performance. When combined with TailwindCSS, you can rapidly build beautiful, responsive interfaces.

## Why Nuxt 3?

Nuxt 3 offers several advantages over traditional Vue.js applications:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Improved SEO and initial load performance
- **Auto-imports** - No need to manually import Vue components and composables
- **File-based routing** - Define routes based on the directory structure
- **Hybrid rendering modes** - Choose between SSR, static generation, or client-side rendering per route

## Setting Up Your Project

Here's how you can set up a new Nuxt 3 project with TailwindCSS:

```bash
# Create a new Nuxt 3 project
npx nuxi init my-nuxt-app

# Change to the project directory
cd my-nuxt-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Add TailwindCSS
npm install -D @nuxtjs/tailwindcss
```

Then, update your `nuxt.config.ts` file:

```typescript
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    '@nuxtjs/tailwindcss'
  ]
})
```

## Styling with TailwindCSS

TailwindCSS makes it easy to create responsive designs without writing custom CSS. Here's an example of a responsive card component:

```vue
<template>
  <div class="max-w-sm rounded overflow-hidden shadow-lg">
    <img class="w-full" src="/img/card-top.jpg" alt="Sunset in the mountains">
    <div class="px-6 py-4">
      <div class="font-bold text-xl mb-2">The Coldest Sunset</div>
      <p class="text-gray-700 text-base">
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="px-6 pt-4 pb-2">
      <span class="inline-block bg-gray-200 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700 mr-2 mb-2">#photography</span>
      <span class="inline-block bg-gray-200 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700 mr-2 mb-2">#travel</span>
      <span class="inline-block bg-gray-200 rounded-full px-3 py-1 text-sm font-semibold text-gray-700 mr-2 mb-2">#winter</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```
